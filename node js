No problem at all 👍 — you don’t need a USB drive for the portable version.

You can simply keep it in a hidden folder on your computer’s hard drive, like:

C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\SystemTools\nodejs-portable


(or any folder you like, even on the Desktop if you plan to delete it later).

💡 Here’s how you can use Node.js portable (no install, no admin, easy to delete):

Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download

Scroll down to “Other Downloads” → “Windows Binary (.zip)”

Choose Windows 64-bit ZIP if your system is 64-bit.

Download the ZIP file (around 35–40 MB).

Right-click it → Extract All... → choose your private folder (e.g. C:\SystemTools\nodejs-portable).

Open that folder → double-click node.exe to check it works.

(Optional) open cmd in that folder and type:

node -v
npm -v


to confirm it runs fine.

That’s it ✅
You can now:

Run Node.js directly from that folder.

Delete the folder anytime to remove all traces.

Hide it (Right-click → Properties → Hidden).



1️⃣ Use Relative Paths with %~dp0

%~dp0 is the folder where the batch file itself lives.

This is key to portability because it doesn’t rely on drive letters or user names.

Example:

set "PATH=%~dp0PortableGit\cmd;%~dp0PortableGit\bin;%~dp0nodejs;%~dp0bun\bin;%PATH%"


Works as long as the folder structure relative to the batch file stays the same:

SystemTools\
│
├── StartPortableDev.bat
├── PortableGit\
├── nodejs\
├── bun\
└── vscode\

2️⃣ Make Your Setup Fully Portable Across PCs
Folder structure (all relative to batch file):
SystemTools\
├─ StartPortableDev.bat
├─ PortableGit\
│  └─ cmd, bin, etc.
├─ nodejs\
│  └─ node.exe
├─ bun\
│  └─ bin\bun.exe
└─ vscode\
   └─ Code.exe

Key rule:

Never move StartPortableDev.bat outside this folder.

Always launch VS Code through this batch file.

3️⃣ Optional: Dynamic Subfolder Detection

If you rename folders or have multiple versions, you can dynamically detect paths:

@echo off
setlocal

:: Detect batch folder
set "BASE=%~dp0"

:: Add tools to PATH
set "PATH=%BASE%PortableGit\cmd;%BASE%PortableGit\bin;%BASE%nodejs;%BASE%bun\bin;%PATH%"

:: Test
where git
where node
where bun

:: Launch VS Code
start "" "%BASE%vscode\Code.exe"
endlocal


%BASE% automatically resolves the folder containing the batch file.

Works regardless of username, drive letter, or PC.

4️⃣ Usage Notes

Copy the entire SystemTools folder to any PC.

Launch StartPortableDev.bat — all tools work immediately.

No system installation required.

Bun, Node, Git, VS Code are all self-contained.

If you want, I can create a ready-to-use portable folder + batch file template that will work on any PC, any drive, any user without touching PATH manually.

Do you want me to do that?
