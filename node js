No problem at all 👍 — you don’t need a USB drive for the portable version.

You can simply keep it in a hidden folder on your computer’s hard drive, like:

C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\SystemTools\nodejs-portable


(or any folder you like, even on the Desktop if you plan to delete it later).

💡 Here’s how you can use Node.js portable (no install, no admin, easy to delete):

Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download

Scroll down to “Other Downloads” → “Windows Binary (.zip)”

Choose Windows 64-bit ZIP if your system is 64-bit.

Download the ZIP file (around 35–40 MB).

Right-click it → Extract All... → choose your private folder (e.g. C:\SystemTools\nodejs-portable).

Open that folder → double-click node.exe to check it works.

(Optional) open cmd in that folder and type:

node -v
npm -v


to confirm it runs fine.

That’s it ✅
You can now:

Run Node.js directly from that folder.

Delete the folder anytime to remove all traces.

Hide it (Right-click → Properties → Hidden).
